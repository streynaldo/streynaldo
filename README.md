### 🧠 About Me
I’m passionate about creating digital solutions that blend great functionality with clean design.  
I focus mainly on backend development, but I’m expanding my skills into SwiftUI, CoreML, and Node.js to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.

Outside of code, I enjoy staying active — 🏸 badminton, 🥊 boxing, and 🏃 running keep me energized and disciplined.
